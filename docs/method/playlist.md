# Creating Spotify Playlists on the Mobile Device
## Steps to creating a playlist
Create the music playlist on Spotify at the bedside with the patient. This will allow the volunteer to assess the patient’s reactions to each song.

1.	Assign a device to the patient and set it up
    1. Review the Music & Memory Playlist poster behind the nursing station and identify a specific Spotify device/account for the patient. 
        1. Each device is logged into a specific Spotify Account (Ex: iPhone / Tablet #3 = Spotify Account #3). 
        2.  Account Usernames and Passwords are located next to the M&M Playlist Poster
    2. Set Up Wifi
        1. Select Wi-Fi “Fraser Health Guest”
        2. Accept Policy

        2. Select Bluetooth and connect assigned headset (iPhone/Tablet #1 = Headset #1)
2.	Open the Spotify App and set it up
    1. Check that the device is logged into the proper Spotify Account (iPhone #2 = Account #2)
    2. If the device you need is not available:
        1. Log into another device with the patient’s username and password
        2. Create the playlist
        3. Log out and back into the original account
3.	Create Playlist
    1. In Spotify, select “Create Playlist”
    2. Click on the Playlist Title
    3. Title the playlist with the patient’s last name and bed #
4.  Add songs to the playlist
    1. Use the search bar to locate songs
    2. Add songs to the playlist
5.	As able, play each song for the patient and discard unwanted ones

8. Clean & charge Equipment
    1. Sanitize Headset and iPhone / Tablet with hospital-grade cleaners using gloves
    2. Plug headset and iPhone into the charging station

# Referral

## Refer a Patient


## Locate the Referral
•	Volunteer Resources receives an electronic referral from Unit 2C at the volunteer administration printer
•	Referrals can be found in room 016 (next to the manager’s office)
•	Check the printer or the Music & Memory Folder mounted next to the door

## Assess the Referral

•	The referral should include the patient’s name and room number
•	The referral will indicate whether the interview is in-person on Unit 2C or by phone with family
•	Phone interviews will include the family members name and contact number

## Steps to Preserve Patient Confidentiality

•	When bringing the paper referral to the unit, fold it to protect patient information and discard in the Fraser Health SHRED-IT box
•	When conducting telephone interviews discard the referral paper in the Fraser Health SHRED-IT box immediately after the call

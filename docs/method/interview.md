# Interview Patient or Family
## Step 2 – Volunteer Conducts the Music & Memory Interview by Phone
The family member name and their phone number will be included in the Volunteer Resources Music & Memory referral sheet. Using the Fraser Health phone in the Volunteer Administration office follow the next six steps:

Telephone Interview Process

1.	Initiate the phone interview using the interview script (see appendix on page 8)

2.	Provide a formal introduction to family

3.	Explain the purpose of the call

4.	Ask permission to conduct the interview

5.	Proceed with the interview when permission is granted

6.	At the end of the interview, thank the family member for participating

If the call goes to the family members voicemail

Read the following script:

“Hello, this is (your name) calling from the Volunteers Office at Burnaby Hospital. My call today is in response to a request to create a music playlist for your family member on Unit 2C (do
not mention the patient’s name). Another volunteer will call back at a future date.”

After providing this voicemail message, return the paper referral to the Music & Memory folder and leave a note to subsequent volunteer regarding the date and time you left the voicemail.

If the family member does not have time for the interview

Offer the family member the Music & Memory email address, which they can use to share the patient’s music preferences (email: Burnabymusic@fraserhealth.ca).

Further Considerations

Family members may choose to spend the phone interview sharing personal stories or comments about their healthcare journey. These interviews can serve to be a helpful source of social engagement for families. Volunteers may need to be flexible and support such conversations beyond the task of gathering the patient’s music preferences. If a patient or family member requests specific medical information or support, acknowledge the importance of these concerns and clarify that as a volunteer, you are not a part of the clinical team.

### Call Script

Hello, my name is (name) and I am a volunteer at the Burnaby Hospital, calling on behalf of unit 2C for (patient name). Is this (family member name)?

This call is not an urgent call about (family member name)’s medical concerns, but I wanted to ask about their music preferences because we are currently running a music therapy program that we believe will improve (patient name)’s hospital experience. We were hoping to put together a personalized playlist that will help evoke positive emotions and memories and to promote overall wellbeing.

Would you be interested in going over some questions that will help us put together a playlist for (patient name)? Or do know any specific music, genre of music, or artists (patient name) enjoys listening to? (Aim for 15 songs minimum and 20 max)

(If family is having trouble identifying specific songs, offer them the email option)

<proceed to go over questions in Appendix C>

Thank you so much for your time! Is there anything else you would like us to note?



## Step 2b – Volunteer Conducts the Music & Memory Interview In-person


On Arrival to the Unit

•	Conduct hand hygiene prior to entering the unit
•	Notify the Nursing staff of the patient scheduled for a music interview
•	Ask if the patient is currently appropriate for the interview
•	If the patient is currently inappropriate for the interview continue to the next patient or supportive Music & Memory duties (see page 7)
•	If appropriate, assess for any new isolation precautions. Do attend a patient bedside where infection precautions are posted
•	Visually assess the patient’s readiness. Look for signs of agitation
•	Provide a formal introduction and proceed with the interview if the patient is calm and cooperative
•	As you begin the interview, ensure that you are positioned outside of the patient’s reach with the ability to exit quickly as needed
•	Proceed with the interview (formal introduction, social ice-breaker that prompts their engagement, ask about the patient’s music preferences, call up songs on Spotify to confirm their preference)
•	Once completed, thank the patient for participating in the interview



Further Considerations

Patients on Unit 2C may be experiencing cognitive challenges due to their medical conditions. As such, Volunteers may need to spend a large portion of the interview listening to their concerns or gently redirecting the conversation back to the topic of music.

These interviews can serve to be a helpful source of social engagement for the patient and identifying patient music preferences may become a process of trial and error.

If a genre is identified, test potential songs with the patient and assess his/her response.

# Trial Existing Playlists with Patients
- Review the M&M Playlist Poster and identify another patient with a music playlist
- Confirm with the primary nurse that the patient is currently appropriate for music
- Offer the music and evaluate his or her response to each song
- If the patient responds poorly to a song, remove it from his/her playlist
- Test news songs from the same artist or genre and assess the patient response
- If patient responds well to a song, add it to his/her playlist
